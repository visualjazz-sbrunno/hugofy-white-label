      ### 1. Introduction (Only an example)


      The Black Dog Institute (ACN 115 954 197) (‘Black Dog Institute’, ‘us’ or ‘we’) recognises and values the importance of protecting the privacy of our stakeholders, collaborators, partners, customers, research participants, clients, prospective clients, patients, prospective patients, relevant health service providers, donors, fundraisers, suppliers and other third parties (‘Individuals’). The Black Dog Institute is a Medical Research Institute and a global leader in translational mental health research. We harness the latest technology and other tools to quickly turn our world-class research findings into clinical services, education and ehealth products that improve the lives of people with mental illness and the wider community. To enable us to fulfill our responsibilities relating to research, education and training, clinical and ehealth services and population health approaches, fundraising, marketing and development, or to otherwise carry out our functions (including, for example, hiring new employees or dealing with suppliers or contractors) (‘Operational Purposes’), we may need to collect a broad range of personal information from individuals.  Black Dog Institute is committed to handling personal information (including health and other sensitive information) in accordance with applicable laws, including the Australian Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). 


      ### 2. What is personal information?


      Definitions of ‘personal information’ differ around the world.  In Australia, the collection, storage, use and disclosure of ‘personal information’ is regulated by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the “Act”).  The Act defines ‘personal information’ as: …information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable

      The definition of ‘personal information’ is therefore extremely broad, but good examples would include your full name and your address.

      Schedule 1 of the Act also sets out thirteen Australian Privacy Principles (the ‘APPs’) which comprehensively cover the protection of personal information.  You can feel confident that we will always collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with the Act, the APPs and this Privacy Policy.


      ### 3. Why do we need to collect your personal information?


      We collect personal information reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities in connection with the Operational Purposes. This personal information may include sensitive information, and in some instances such as where you receive clinical or ehealth services, may include health information. You may decide to provide your personal information to Black Dog Institute for a range of different reasons. By way of example you may wish to:


      * participate in a research project;

      * donate money to Black Dog Institute;

      * fundraise for Black Dog Institute;

      * collaborate with Black Dog Institute;
