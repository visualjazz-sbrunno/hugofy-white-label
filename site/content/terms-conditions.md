    title: Time and resources needed
    content: >-
      PwC’s main challenge in 2016 was not knowing whether people would pick up
      and wear a green ribbon, so in the build up to launch PwC did a huge
      amount of communication around what it meant to wear a green ribbon. PwC
      didn’t want people to just wear one and not realise that it was showing a
      willingness to have a conversation and listen to someone. To help with
      this the firm created a flyer that people could take with them to client
      sites, explaining what the green ribbon symbolised. A second challenge is
      that PwC has a lot of people working off-site remotely. In order to reach
      those people with the Green Ribbon campaign PwC created a virtual green
      ribbon that people could put on their e-mail signatures.


      A third challenge was getting the balance between setting up the campaign and not wanting to control it too much and stifle creativity. Every year PwC produces a Green Light to Talk Resource Toolkit which has ideas as to what local teams can do and how they can bring the campaign to life. The Toolkit provides some structure and acts as a starting point for teams to create their own ideas. Examples of team-led initiatives include:


      * The Samaritans is one of PwC’s partner charities. As part of this the firm holds ‘One Firm One Brew’ events where people have a cup of tea, cake and talk whilst also making a donation to the Samaritans.

      * Walk n’ Talks. Organizing times where people can go for a lunchtime walk led by wellbeing champions. This is an opportunity to connect, have conversations and check in with each other.
