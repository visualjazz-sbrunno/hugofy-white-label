### The challenge

The campaign Green Light to Talk was launched in May 2016, during Mental Health Awareness Week, with the objective of normalising conversations around mental well-being and mental ill-health.

There were three key aspects of the campaign from the beginning:

1. **Wearing a green ribbon.** PwC created ‘Green Light to Talk’ day on the Thursday of Mental Health Awareness Week. On this day people were invited to wear a green ribbon as a visible demonstration that they were happy to have conversations about mental health.
2. **Storytelling.** Beyond the Green Light to Talk day, PwC wanted to sustain the change in culture and encourage conversations around mental health all year round. Every month since May 2016,a PwC employee has told their mental health story, creating a simple and personal video. This is shared as part of the ‘Green Light to Talk series’, right across the fim via its intranet news channel.
3. **Mental Health Advocates.** PwC wanted to create multiple pathways of support and also show strong leadership in this space. A group of six senior partners volunteered to share their mental health story widely and be available to talk to employees who were concerned about themselves or someone else. Their role is to listen in confidence and without judgement, and signpost to the right support. There are now 22 Mental Health Advocates across the UK.
