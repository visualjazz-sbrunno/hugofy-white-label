      ### How we respond


      The campaign Green Light to Talk was launched in May 2016, during Mental Health Awareness Week, with the objective of normalising conversations around mental well-being and mental ill-health.


      * **Green ribbon**: A key result of the Green Light to Talk campaign is that in 2017 the Lord Mayor’s Appeal approached PwC and asked to incorporate the Green Ribbon into the This is Me campaign, complementing This is Me story-telling from Barclays. As a result, this has gone far beyond just a PwC campaign and in Mental Health Awareness Week 2019 over 250,000 people wore a green ribbon across the UK. In addition, increasingly people at PwC are wearing green ribbons all year around and taking them to client sites. PwC has now launched this campaign in other offices around the world including Australia and the US.

      PwC’s main challenge in 2016 was not knowing whether people would pick up
      and wear a green ribbon, so in the build up to launch PwC did a huge
      amount of communication around what it meant to wear a green ribbon. PwC
      didn’t want people to just wear one and not realise that it was showing a
      willingness to have a conversation and listen to someone. To help with
      this the firm created a flyer that people could take with them to client
      sites, explaining what the green ribbon symbolised.

      A second challenge is that PwC has a lot of people working off-site remotely. In order to reach those people with the Green Ribbon campaign PwC created a virtual green ribbon that people could put on their e-mail signatures.

      A third challenge was getting the balance between setting up the campaign and not wanting to control it too much and stifle creativity. Every year PwC produces a Green Light to Talk Resource Toolkit which has ideas as to what local teams can do and how they can bring the campaign to life. The Toolkit provides some structure and acts as a starting point for teams to create their own ideas. Examples of team-led initiatives include:

      ### Outcomes


      * It was important to make the mental health awareness campaign more than just about the ribbon. Whilst the wearing of the ribbon is fundamental, and showing visible support is essential, it is important organisations think about what goes with that and how to facilitate the conversation to really generate culture change. For example, training in mental health literacy, effective signposting to sources of help and support, and sustained and engaging communications are key.

### The Challenge

The campaign Green Light to Talk was launched in May 2016, during Mental Health Awareness Week, with the objective of normalising conversations around mental well-being and mental ill-health.
There were three key aspects of the campaign from the beginning:

1. **Wearing a green ribbon**. PwC created ‘Green Light to Talk’ day on the Thursday of Mental Health Awareness Week. On this day people were invited to wear a green ribbon as a visible demonstration that they were happy to have conversations about mental health.
2. **Storytelling**. Beyond the Green Light to Talk day, PwC wanted to sustain the change in culture and encourage conversations around mental health all year round. Every month since May 2016,a PwC employee has told their mental health story, creating a simple and personal video. This is shared as part of the ‘Green Light to Talk series’, right across the fim via its intranet news channel.
